# Geometric Characterization Workflow
[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

This tutorial includes a set of Jupyter Notebooks for the geometric characterization of porous media images from the Digital Rocks Portal. There are three notebooks for the characterization. These are:
1. Minkowski Functionals;
2. Heterogeneity Measurement;
3. Competent Subset Selection.

In (1), we calculate four Minkowski functionals in 3D. These functionals are volume, surface area, integral mean curvature, and Euler characteristic.

In (2), we measure whether a rock sample is heterogeneous or homogeneous based on scale-independent porosity variance calculations within a moving window of increasing size.

In (3), we chose a subset of the data that is good enough for visualization, simulation, and 3D printing.
