# Geometric Characterization Workflow
[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

This tutorial includes a set of Jupyter Notebooks for the geometric characterization of porous media images from the Digital Rocks Portal. There are three notebooks for the characterization. These are:
1. Minkowski Functionals;
2. Heterogeneity Measurement;
3. Competent Subset Selection.

In (1), we calculate four Minkowski functionals in 3D. These functionals are volume, surface area, integral mean curvature, and Euler characteristic.

In (2), we measure whether a rock sample is heterogeneous or homogeneous based on scale-independent porosity variance calculations within a moving window of increasing size.

In (3), we chose a subset of the data that is good enough for visualization, simulation, and 3D printing.
